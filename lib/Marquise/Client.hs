-- | Marquise client interface for sending data to the vault.
--
-- This module provides functions for preparing and queuing points to be sent
-- by a Marquise server to the vault.
--
-- If you call close, you can be assured that your data is safe and will at
-- some point end up in the data vault (excluiding local disk failure). This
-- assumption is based on a functional marquise daemon with connectivity
-- eventually running within your namespace.
-- 
-- We provide no way to *absolutely* ensure that a point is currently written
-- to the vault. Such a guarantee would require blocking and complex queuing,
-- or observing various underlying mechanisms that should ideally remain
-- abstract.
